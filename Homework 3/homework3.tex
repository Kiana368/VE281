\section*{Before you start:}

\subsection*{Homework Files}
You can download the starter files for coding as well as this \textit{tex} file (you only need to modify \textit{homework3.tex}) on canvas and do your homework with latex. Or you can scan your handwriting, convert to pdf file, and upload it to canvas before the due date. If you choose to write down your answers by hand, you can directly download the pdf file on canvas which provides more blank space for solution box.\\

\subsection*{Submission Form}
For homework 3, there are only one part of submission, which is a pdf file as your solution named as VE281\_HW3\_[Your Student ID]\_[Your name].pdf uploaded to canvas.

Estimated time used for this homework: \textbf{3-4 hours.}

\section{Min Heap (23 points)}
Consider a min-heap represented by the following array:
\begin{align*}
\{2, 3, 8, 16, 46, 34, 42, 35, 26\}
\end{align*}

Perform the following operations using the algorithms for binary heaps discussed in lecture. Ensure that the heap property is restored at the end of every individual operation.

For the following operations, tell how many percolations(either up or down) are needed and show the result of the heap after each \textbf{percolation} in either tree form or array form. 

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Push the value of 1 into this min-heap. (4 points)
\begin{solution}
%Write your answer here.
\end{solution}

\item After a), push the value of 5 into this min-heap. (4 points)
\begin{solution}
%Write your answer here.
\end{solution}

\item After b), update element 2 to have a value of 37 (Suppose you have the access to each element). (5 points)
\begin{solution}
%Write your answer here.
\end{solution}

\item After c), remove the min element from the heap. (5 points)
\begin{solution}
%Write your answer here.
\end{solution}

\item After d), update element 26 to have a value of 4 (Suppose you have the access to each element) (5 points)
\begin{solution}
%Write your answer here.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Binary Search Tree (30 points)}

\item Delete 29 (3 points)

\end{solution}

\item Insert 22 (3 points)
\begin{solution}
%Write your answer here.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}
%Write your answer here.
\end{solution}


\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Better than linear selection? (14 points)}
After learning the application of the BST, Coned thinks that with BST, rank search can be done either in a faster way or with less space compared with the linear selection algorithms introduced in the lecture.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item Compare BST rank search with deterministic selection algorithm in terms of time complexity and space usage. Assume that for each node, a variable \textit{leftsize} is maintained as introduced in the lecture. (8 points)
    \begin{solution}
    %Write your answer here.
    \end{solution}
    \item William, our master of algorithm, has a different idea again. He states that for the linear selection algorithm, the input can be arbitrary array while for BST rank search, you have to first build up a binary search tree from the arbitrary array, which will also take some time. Therefore, the average time complexity of BST rank search is not better than $O(n)$. Is he right? (6 points)\\
    Assume that we are working on a fixed array and doing lots of rank search.
    \begin{solution}
    %Write your answer here.
    \end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
