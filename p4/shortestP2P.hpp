      /* Read the graph from stdin
       * The input has the following format:
       *
       * Firstline: 1 unsigned int, the total number of verticies, X.
       * Secondline: 1 unsigned int, the total number of edges between vertices, Y.
       * A set of Y lines, each line contains tuple of 2 unsigned int and 1 int (not unsigned int!), in the format of: A(point 1, unsigned) B(point 2, unsigned) dist(distance, int)
       *
       * Example:
       * 4
       * 4
       * 0 1 5
       * 1 2 -1
       * 2 3 4
       * 3 1 6
       * 
       * 
       * 
       *
       * Vertices that are not connected have a infinitly large distance. You may use INF (previously defined at the top of this cope snippet) for infinitly large distance.
       * 
       * Special: when the graph is not proper, where there exist any pair of vertices whose minimum distance does not exist, terminate immediately by printing:
       * cout << "Invalid graph. Exiting." << endl;
       *
       * Note: vertex pairs that are not connected, which have infinitely large distances are not considered cases where "minimum distances do not exist".
